## üì¨ **Email Vectorization Pipeline**

This project phase aims to enhance functionality through the use of **n8n** to automate the upload of generated email content into **Pinecone vector store** facilitating semantic retrieval through an agent powered by **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

### üß† **Overview**

Continuing from the previous stage where emails were generated in `Generate_Emails_google_sheets.json` module, this process performs the following steps:

1. **Extracts** the specific spreadsheet cells that contain the contact **names** and the **generated email content**.
2. **Creates** a **Google Sheets** document to organise and store the extracted data.
3. **Uploads** the document contents into **Pinecone**, where the data is vectorized for intelligent retrieval.

This enables LLM-powered agents to search and retrieve emails based on natural language queries.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Workflow**

#### **Data Extraction**
- Downloads the data from Google Drive and reads the Google Sheet using the **Google Sheets API**.
- Parses the data structure output by `generate_emails`.
- Isolates relevant fields (e.g., columns: **Name**, **Email**).

#### **Google Sheet Creation**
- Initializes a new Google Sheet using the **Google Sheets API**.
- Populates it with the **name-email pairs**.

#### **Pinecone Upload**
- Connects to an existing **Pinecone index**.
- Converts email text into embeddings using an **OpenAI model**.
- Uploads the vectors along with metadata (e.g., **name**, **content tags**) into Pinecone.

### üìå **Purpose**

This step makes it possible to:

- Perform **semantic search** over generated emails.
- Enable **context-aware memory** for LLM agents.
- Support **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** applications.
