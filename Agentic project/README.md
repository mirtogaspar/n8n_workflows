AI-Powered Internal News Delivery System with n8n and GPT-4o

Description:
Designed and implemented an intelligent on-premise automation system using the low-code platform n8n for Fujitsu Luxembourg (internship project). This project automates the daily delivery of AI-related news to technical employees through a pipeline that:

Scrapes and filters news articles from multiple sources

Uses GPT-4o agents to categorize, summarize, and translate content

Sends personalized email digests based on user preferences

Includes a self-managed subscription form integrated with a database
Custom JavaScript and SQL functions were developed within n8n to extend native capabilities, enabling robust data handling and full system autonomy. This marks the first internal Agentic system at Fujitsu Luxembourg, laying the groundwork for autonomous workflow automation across departments.
